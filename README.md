APAAR Link: A Blockchain-based Student Record System

APAAR Link is an innovative project that leverages blockchain technology to store and manage student records securely and efficiently. It provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter, 
a Python library for creating GUIs. The records include various information such as APAAR ID, name, class, marks, achievements, competition, and remarks. APAAR ID is a unique 12-digit identification number that tracks 
studentsâ€™ academic journey and achievements. APAAR is the new Indian standard for student record management, as per the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. We have implemented Apaar using a simple and elegant 
interface in Python, a popular and versatile programming language. We have also planned to add more features and functionalities to APAAR Link in the future.
